            <h2>The Accountability Partner You Can Eat With</h2>
            <p>Foodbuddy aimed to solve the hardest part of dieting: consistency. Most trackers require tedious manual
                entry. Foodbuddy used early multimodal AI models to simply allow users to "snap and track". But beyond
                tracking, it was about <em>accountability</em>.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "People don't need another calculator. They need a friend who gently judges their late-night pizza."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Core Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Snap-to-Track:</strong> Leveraging GPT-4 Vision (and later Gemini Pro Vision), users could
                    upload a photo of their meal. The AI estimated calories, macros, and ingredients with surprising
                    accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>The AI Coach:</strong> A personality-driven AI chatbot that would comment on your meals. It
                    could be supportive ("Great salad!") or sassy ("Is that your third cookie?").</li>
                <li><strong>Social Circles:</strong> Small, private groups where friends could see each other's logs—not
                    the specific calories, but a "Health Score" for the day, fostering positive peer pressure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Backend Architecture</h2>
            <p>We hosted the core services on a <strong>GCP e2-micro</strong> instance to keep costs near zero. The
                challenge was managing the heavy lifting of image processing.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Handling the image upload and analysis queue
const processImageQueue = async (imageUrl, userId) => {
    // Determine complexity
    const analysis = await aiService.analyzeFood(imageUrl);
    
    // Store nutritional data
    await db.saveLog({
        userId,
        calories: analysis.calories,
        macros: analysis.macros,
        image: imageUrl
    });
    
    // Trigger the accountability agent
    await coachAgent.reactToMeal(userId, analysis);
}</code></pre>

            <h2>Why It's Unmaintained</h2>
            <p>While the prototype was functional and the "snap-to-track" feature was magical, the unit economics of
                processing every meal image with high-end LLMs were difficult for a free side project. Additionally, the
                latency in 2023 for vision models was a friction point.</p>

            <p>However, the lessons learned here directly influenced the "Context Engineering" work in later projects
                like FileOps.</p>
