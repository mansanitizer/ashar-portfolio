            <h2>Making Recruitment Fun?</h2>
            <p>Let's be honest: reviewing CVs is boring. "Spot the Fake CV" is a gamified take on the hiring process. It
                challenges HR professionals and hiring managers to identify AI-generated or obviously fake bullet points
                hidden among real, high-quality achievements.</p>

            <p>It turns the mundane task of screening into a competitive sport.</p>

            <h2>The Game Loop</h2>
            <p>The rules are simple: You are presented with 4 bullet points. 3 are real, high-impact achievements (e.g.,
                "Increased revenue by 20%..."). 1 is a plausible but fake hallucination. You have 10 seconds to spot the
                fake.</p>

            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>The game is built with vanilla JavaScript for maximum performance and zero dependencies. However, the
                content is dynamic.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> We used a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model to generate thousands of
                    "fake" CV bullets that sound <em>almost</em> real but have subtle flaws (e.g., impossible metrics,
                    vague buzzwords).</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring Algorithm:</strong> The score isn't just +1 for a correct answer. It factors in
                    speed and streaks, rewarding "flow state".</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We track which "fakes" trick people the most, effectively building a
                    dataset of "what a believable lie looks like" vs "what a good resume looks like".</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                "Gamification is the most effective way to test domain expertise. If you can't spot the lie, do you know
                the job?"
            </blockquote>
