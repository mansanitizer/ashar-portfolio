            <h2>Agents as Editors</h2>
            <p>Editing large technical documents is tedious. You need to check for grammar, consistency in tone,
                formatting standards, and technical accuracy. Doing this sequentially takes hours. I wanted to see if I
                could spin up a "team" of AI agents to do it in parallel.</p>

            <p>Using the <strong>CrewAI</strong> framework, I built a system where different agents took on different
                personas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Grammarian:</strong> Focused solely on syntax and grammar.</li>
                <li><strong>The Stylist:</strong> Ensured the tone matched the target audience (e.g., "professional" vs
                    "casual").</li>
                <li><strong>The Fact-Checker:</strong> Cross-referenced claims (limited to internal consistency).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Workflow</h2>
            <p>The system digests a PDF, splits it into chunks, and assigns these chunks to the agent crew. The agents
                critique the text and propose changes. A final "Manager Agent" reviews these proposals and compiles the
                final output.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-python"># Defining the agents
editor = Agent(
  role='Senior Editor',
  goal='Ensure the document flows logically and is free of errors',
  backstory="""You are a veteran editor at a top tech publisher. 
  You hate passive voice and love clarity.""",
  verbose=True,
  allow_delegation=True
)

# Defining the task
proofread_task = Task(
  description=f"""Analyze the following text section: {text_chunk}""",
  agent=editor
)</code></pre>

            <h2>Challenges & Learnings</h2>
            <p>Building this taught me a lot about <strong>Agent orchestration</strong>. The biggest challenge was
                "hallucination loops," where one agent would correct something, and another would correct it back.
                Strict prompt engineering and clear hierarchy (using the Manager agent) were essential to break these
                loops.</p>

            <p>While effective for rough drafts, I found that for final polish, a human in the loop is still
                indispensable. However, this tool cut down the "first pass" editing time by about 80%.</p>
